The concept is simple: computer science is not software engineering. By itself, the statement seems obviously true. Unfortunately our industry has a problem with conflating the two in a way that leads to bad outcomes in the products engineers create.
An analogy with cars I like to compare it to the difference between physics and mechanical engineering.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/posts/computer-science-software-engineering/>more →</a></div></article><article class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://shane.ai/posts/backtraces-with-strace/>Backtraces with strace</a></h1><div class=post-meta><time class=post-date>2023-11-06</time><span class=post-author>[shane]</span></div><div class=post-content>I discovered strace somewhere between my first part time web development part time job in 2005 and my first full time &ldquo;software engineering&rdquo; job in 2008, and it seemed like a superpower giving me x-ray vision into running infrastructure. When a process was stuck, or existing after a cryptic error message, instead of grepping around I could get a pretty good timeline of what the process was up to.
It has some fatal flaws, the ptrace based technology can cause performance issues so it&rsquo;s mostly not suited to running in production (unless you were one of my personal heros: the old mysql@facebook team which liked to live dangerously and often used ptrace based debuggers to obtain life profiling data).</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/posts/backtraces-with-strace/>more →</a></div></article><article class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://shane.ai/posts/notes-on-javascript-jit-deopt/>Some notes on javascript jit and deopt</a></h1><div class=post-meta><time class=post-date>2023-09-26</time><span class=post-author>[shane]</span></div><div class=post-content>Recently I read a fantastic article walking through jit optimizations and how changes to source code could impact those: Side effecting a deopt.
As I shared it with folks, a few of them had some questions about low level optmizations in general and I wrote this as a little explainer for people who are interested in learning more about how javascript runtimes can model/compile/jit/execute their js code.

Disclaimer While alot of this article argues that &ldquo;Cgo performance is good actually&rdquo;, please don&rsquo;t take that to mean &ldquo;Cgo is good actually&rdquo;.

I&rsquo;ve decided to write my own still-over-simplified all in one guide to the difference between a couple popular threads and fiber implementations. In order to keep this a blog post and not a novel I&rsquo;m just going to focus on linux threads, go goroutines, and rust threads.
tl;dr - Rust threads on linux use 8kb of memory, Goroutines use 2kb.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/posts/threads-and-goroutines/>more →</a></div></article><article class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://shane.ai/posts/load-testing-tips/>Load Testing Tips</a></h1><div class=post-meta><time class=post-date>2022-12-28</time></div><div class=post-content>Load testing tips Over a decade plus of getting retailers ready for a smooth Black Friday I&rsquo;ve collected a few tips, tricks, and stories related to keeping busy applications online during big events.
In fact there&rsquo;s one simple (not easy!) trick to it: the best way to ensure your website can handle a big event is to have your website handle a big event. That may seem like a tautology, but it&rsquo;s where this post starts and it&rsquo;s where it ends.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/posts/load-testing-tips/>more →</a></div></article><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__buttons></div></div></div></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class=copyright><span>© 2025 Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></span>
